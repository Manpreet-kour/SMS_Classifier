Spam Classifier
Overview
This project involves creating a spam classifier using a dataset of spam messages. The classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages using various machine learning models. The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy and precision, and results are visualized using plots.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset file (spam.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Plots and evaluation results.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk (for natural language processing)
xgboost (if used)
You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk xgboost
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is spam.csv, which contains spam and non-spam messages. The data is structured as follows:

text: The content of the message.
label: The label indicating whether the message is spam or not.
Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration.
Text Processing: Tokenized the text, removed stop words, and performed stemming.
Feature Extraction: Converted text data into numerical features using techniques such as Count Vectorization or TF-IDF.
Models
The following classifiers were used in this project:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
Decision Tree Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier
Bagging Classifier
Extra Trees Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XGBoost Classifier (if available)
Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified messages.
Precision: The proportion of true positive messages out of all predicted positive messages.
Results
The performance of each model was plotted to compare accuracy and precision. Visualization of results helps in understanding which models perform better for spam classification.

Usage
Preprocess Data: Run the preprocessing scripts to prepare the dataset.
Train Models: Use the training scripts to train the classifiers on the processed data.
Evaluate Models: Evaluate the models and plot the results using the evaluation scripts.
Example
Here is an example of how to use the scripts:

python
Copy code
# Example code to train and evaluate models
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('data/spam.csv')
X = data['text']
y = data['label']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression)
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, y_pred))
